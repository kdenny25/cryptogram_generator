# Cryptogram Generator

Disclaimer: This is an imperfect app but it gets the job done. 

Selecting an excel spreadsheet with a list of phrase will return
a new spreasheet with a column of encrypted phrases along with hints.

10/17/2022 - At this time the features are all hardcoded. It only accepts
.xlsx files and produces a set (3) amount of hints. The UI is only limited
to a file selection box. 

Future Features Include:

* Improved UI using a customer version of Tkinter - https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter
* Customize number of hints
* Selecting how hints are produced. (Frequency, Random)
* Ability to save the file rather than automatically producing it.
* Support for multiple file formats i.e. (.csv and maybe .docx)
* Visual of encrypted files in UI
